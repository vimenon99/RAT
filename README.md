# Keylogger and Remote Command Execution

This project consists of a simple client-server application written in Python that includes a keylogger and remote command execution functionality. The client can be used to execute commands on the machine where it's running and send keystrokes to a log file.

## Overview

- **Client**: Connects to a remote server, receives commands, executes them, and sends the results back to the server. Includes a keylogger and encryption/decryption capabilities.
- **Server**: Listens for incoming connections from clients, sends commands to the client, and receives responses.

## Features

- **Keylogging**: Logs keystrokes to a file.
- **Command Execution**: Executes a range of system commands (e.g., `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `read`, etc.).
- **File Encryption/Decryption**: Encrypts and decrypts files using AES encryption.
- **Networking**: Uses sockets to establish communication between the client and server.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages:
  - `pynput`
  - `cryptography`

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pynput cryptography
```

## Usage

### Server

1. Run the server script:

    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```

2. The server will start listening for incoming connections on port `4445`.

### Client

1. Run the client script:

    ```bash
    python client.py
    ```

2. The client will connect to the server and await commands.

### Commands

The following commands can be sent from the server to the client:

- **Basic Commands**:
  - `ls`: List directory contents.
  - `pwd`: Print working directory.
  - `cd <path>`: Change directory.
  - `mkdir <directory>`: Create a new directory.
  - `read <filename>`: Read a file.
  - `write <filename> <content>`: Write content to a file.
  - `delete <filename>`: Delete a file.
  - `rename <old_filename> <new_filename>`: Rename a file.
  - `copy <source_file> <destination_file>`: Copy a file.
  - `ps`: List running processes.
  - `kill <process_id>`: Kill a process.
  - `uname -a`: Display system information.
  - `whoami`: Display current user.
  - `netstat`: Display network connections.
  - `ping <host>`: Ping a host.
  - `traceroute <host>`: Trace the route to a host.
  - `shutdown`: Restart the system.
  - `sleep`: Put the system to sleep.

- **Keylogger Commands**:
  - `start_keylogger`: Start keylogging.
  - `stop_keylogger`: Stop keylogging.

- **File Encryption/Decryption**:
  - `encrypt <filename> <key>`: Encrypt a file with a given key.
  - `decrypt <encrypted_filename> <key>`: Decrypt a file with a given key.

## Security and Ethics

- **Important**: This script is intended for educational purposes only. Use it responsibly and ensure you have permission before running it on any system.
- **Note**: Unauthorized keylogging and remote command execution can be illegal and unethical. Always follow legal guidelines and ethical practices when using such tools.
